# MorseKeyer
Morse key to computer keyboard input using Sparkfun Pro Micro (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/introduction)

Since the Pro Micro offers true USB functionality, should be a plug & play device for turning morse into ASCII.
C++ Arduino Code to upload to microcontroller, uses the Keyboard library.


Based on Morse library from Google's Gboard Morse Language keyboard:
